*to do:*
nate: 
    (feel free to pass any tasks to daniel. not sure how much you were able to fill him in a couple days ago)
    1. create df from data.csv
    2. try to manipulate data/create visualizations (time as x-variable) 
        to see if there's any patterns in the data
    3. write analysis or bullet points for analysis for me or daniel to write

sonya:
    - create more to do items 
    - either write analysis about patterns in characteristics of songs during diff pds or
        classify groups of characteristics with moods
    - predictive
    
daniel:
    - talk w nate in gc about findings in data to figure out what patterns to talk about in
         analysis
    - write analysis/bullet points for analysis 
    - start thinking about coding for predictive algorithm (we can work together on this since 
        nate was more interested in analysis rather than prediction)
